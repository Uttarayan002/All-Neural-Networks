## Neural Network Architectures
### Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
ANNs are the foundation of deep learning. They consist of layers of interconnected neurons and are used for tasks like regression and classification.

- Explanation : ANN/ann_explanation.md

- Code : ANN/ann_code.py

### Dense Neural Networks (DNNs)
DNNs are fully connected networks where each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. They are ideal for tabular data.

- Explanation : DNN/dnn_explanation.md
- Code : DNN/dnn_code.py

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs are designed for sequential data and can capture temporal dependencies. Variants like LSTM and GRU are commonly used.
- Explanation : RNN/rnn_explanation.md
- Code : RNN/rnn_code.py

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs excel at processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to extract spatial features.

- Explanation : CNN/cnn_explanation.md
- Code : CNN/cnn_code.py
